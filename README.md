<h1>Hello</h1>
Assign two parameters for your main function.

    The first parameter should be an integer such as int argc
    The second parameter should be an array of string pointers such as char *argv[]


Print one line describing your program
Open the first parameter as a file for writing. If no parameter is provided, write to the stdout FILE pointer
Using a loop, save the contents of the array of string pointers passed as a parameter to the main function into the file open for writing. This is usually the variable named argv.
After the loop is complete, print the number of string that were printed to the console.
